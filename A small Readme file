<h1>ABC India Web Application</h1>
<h2>This is a simple single-page web application that simulates a basic website for "ABC India" with navigation, user authentication, and a dashboard.<h2>

<h3>Features</h3>
Pages: Home, About Us, Contact Us, Login, and Sign Up.
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, access a dashboard, and log out.
Dashboard: Provides a welcome message and navigation links for logged-in users.
Data Storage: Uses localStorage for storing and retrieving user data.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
HTML for structure.
CSS for styling.
JavaScript for functionality and localStorage management.

<h3>How It Works</h3>
